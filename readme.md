# Laravel CRUDDY Controllers 
by Koyanyaroo

# The Background
After watching [Adam Wathan](https://github.com/adamwathan) talks about **"Cruddy by Design"** at [**Laracon 2017 NYC** ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0jFKvS4SI), it makes me realizes that there is a way to solved my confusedness about choosing or put the action within the controllers.

# The Goals
So with this repository I hope I can at least implementing the fundamentals about Cruddy Controllers in Laravel as per Adam talks.

# Scopes
Here I try to replicate the fundamentals about Cruddy Controllers, in the different domain.
Let's imagine that we have an Article or a Blog Post Controller, that allows us to comment every post as a Guest user.
